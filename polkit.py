def check_authv(pid, action_ids):
    """
    A simple convenience function to check whether a given
    process is authorized for a number of actions.

    This is useful for programs that just wants to check whether
    they should carry out some action. Note that the user identity
    used for the purpose of checking authorizations is the Real
    one compared to the e.g. Effective one (e.g. getuid(), getgid()
    is used instead of e.g. geteuid(), getegid()). This is typically
    what one wants in a setuid root program if the setuid root program
    is designed to do work on behalf of the unprivileged user who
    invoked it (for example, the PulseAudio sound server is setuid
    root only so it can become a real time process; after that it
    drops all privileges).

    It varies whether one wants to pass getpid() or getppid() as
    the process id to this function. For example, in the PulseAudio
    case it is the right thing to pass getpid(). However, in a setup
    where the process is a privileged helper, one wants to pass the
    process id of the parent. Beware though, if the parent dies, getppid()
    will return 1 (the process id of /sbin/init) which is almost
    certainly guaranteed to be privileged as it is running as uid 0.

    Note that this function will open a connection to the system
    message bus and query ConsoleKit for details. In addition, it
    will load PolicyKit specific files and spawn privileged helpers
    if necessary. As such, there is a bit of IPC, context switching,
    syscall overhead and I/O involved in using this function.
